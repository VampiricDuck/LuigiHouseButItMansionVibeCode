Minigames folder (dev)

This folder contains minimal dev implementations of classic minigames for troubleshooting and prototype purposes:

- minesweeper.html — tiny 8x8 minesweeper
- snake.html — simple snake with keyboard controls
- tetris.html — minimal falling-blocks game

Open these files directly from the main project's dev menu while testing.
